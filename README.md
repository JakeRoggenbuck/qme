This is the GitHub repository for our game. Here are some descriptions of the various folders:<br/>
**res**: the folder for audio clips, sound files, etc.<br/>
**saves**: world saves, preference settings, etc. This file will be specific to each user.<br/>
**src**: source code for the game.

If you need to add something to this page but aren't sure how, please contact a programmer,
preferably JakeRoggenbuck (@vc_cypher, GitHub lead).

The code can only be built with Eclipse for now. If you need a new release, contact a programmer
running the same OS as you to build it, or check the "Releases" tab.
